"""QQ bot entry for /find (FTL MV).

Simplified per requested logic:
- Exact event-id match (case-insensitive) short-circuits and expands only that event.
- Text search scans each <event> node's own text only:
  - Skip nested <event>, <loadEvent>, <loadEventList> entirely.
  - Include text from <text load="..."> (textList) only.
- If a match lies in an anonymous event, map to the nearest named ancestor event.
